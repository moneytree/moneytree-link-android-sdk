# AwesomeApp

The `AwesomeApp` is a reference app that showcases the SDK's capabilities. It is there to help you understand some of the SDK's base use cases. Feel free to edit it as you please.

## SDK configuration in the AwesomeApp

To configure `AwesomeApp` head to `gradle.properties`. Configuration options are:

* `linkEnvironment`: as `staging` or `production`
* `linkClientId`: your client ID (make sure it matches the envirnoment)

Alternatively you can edit the source code as you see fit.

> :information_source: This is **NOT** part of the SDK's spec, just done so in the AwesomeApp. You can implement the configuration of the SDK in any way you prefer.

You should now be able to build and use Awesome App.
